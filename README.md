# q-REST

An open source REST service written in java 8 used to connect to an instance of kdb using JSON. The REST service can
provide a single query to run or call a function predefined on the instance of kdb.

## Pre-requisite Configuration

##### Properties

There is an `application.properties` file in the resources folder, connect the rest service and the instance of kdb by
updating the properties below:

    kdb.host=localhost
    kdb.port=6007
    kdb.username=admin
    kdb.password=admin
    server.port=8080

##### Certificates

The requests are sent in HTTPS format and to provide this the project has a self-signed certifiate embedded within. It
is strongly recommended that you add your own certificate. Updating the certificate will require an update to the
following properties in `application.properties`:

    security.require-ssl=true
    server.ssl.key-store-type=PKCS12
    server.ssl.key-store=classpath:keystore.p12
    server.ssl.key-store-password=aquaq2018
    server.ssl.key-alias=tomcat

##### Authentication

The q-REST service uses basic authentication and is using a single username and password which are configured in
the `application.properties` file:

    basic.authentication.user=user
    basic.authentication.password=pass

These value are provided within the header of the request, it is strongly recommended to invoke your own security if you
use the project.

## EndPoints

The q-REST service provides two endpoints: executeFunction and executeQuery.

##### ExecuteFunction Request

The executeFunction provides a means to call a predefined function and pass parameters to the kdb instance.
For example this is the format of a request calling a function called plus which passes two arguments labelled "xarg"
and "yarg" with values 96.3 and 9.7:

e.g. FunctionRequest

    {
    "function_name" : "plus",
    "arguments" : 
            {
                "xarg" : "96.3",
                "yarg" : "9.7"
             }
    }

##### ExecuteQuery Request

The executeQuery provides a means to provide a query to the kdb instance, by default this endpoint is disabled using the
property freeform.query.mode.enabled, to enable change the value to true.
For example this is the format of a synchronous query request where the user expects a response to be returned:

e.g. QueryRequest

    {
        "type" : "sync",   
        "query" : "select from table",
        "response" : true
    }

##### Response from q-REST API

The json response for the endpoint calls will comprise of 4 parts: `result`, `requestTime`, `responseTime`
and `success`.

- Result is the response returned by KDB with some additional parsing.

- RequestTime is the time the time the request began processing on the api.

- ResponseTime is the time the response was returned from the api.

- Success is a boolean which lets user know if the call to kdb was a success.

e.g. `"query" : "([]a:enlist\"hello world\")"` this should return a single item

    [
        {
            "result": [
                {
                    "a": "hello world"
                }
            ],
            "requestTime": "2018-06-14T09:05:12.513Z",
            "responseTime": "2018-06-14T09:05:12.528Z",
            "success": true
        }
    ]

e.g. `"query" : "([]a:(\"hello\";\"world\"))"` this should return a list of strings

    [
        {
            "result": [
                {
                    "a": "hello"
                },
                {
                    "a": "world"
                }
            ],
            "requestTime": "2018-06-14T09:05:51.610Z",
            "responseTime": "2018-06-14T09:05:51.620Z",
            "success": true
        }
    ]   

Failure response will follow a similar pattern except result will the error returned

e.g `"query" : "([]a:enlist hello world)"` Failure response (query should have quotes around the hello world therefore
KDB fails) will follow a similar pattern except result will be the error returned

    [
        {
            "result": "error: failed to run query on server localhost:34203: world",
            "requestTime": "2018-06-14T09:04:28.634Z",
            "responseTime": "2018-06-14T09:04:28.649Z",
            "success": false
        }
    ]

## Deploying

Pre-requisite: java 8 installed

1. Configure your own application.properties file to point to your specific kdb instance and create an active profile:

```
# application-test.properties
kdb.host=localhost
kdb.port=6007
db.username=admin
db.password=admin
server.port=8080
```

2. Download the most recent jar from release section of github
   master (https://github.com/AquaQAnalytics/q-REST/releases/)

3. Run following command from command prompt (ensure you select your application.properties file created in step 1):

       java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=test -Dspring.config.location=PathToFile\application.properties q-REST-1.0.0_RELEASE.jar

* -Dspring.profiles.active would be the profile you wish to run the application with which would have its
  own `application-{profileName}.properties` file.

* -Dspring.config.location would be the location of the custom properties file.

Alternatively, you can download the source code from git hub, update the project with your changes, run a maven build,
then run project from your chosen ide by executing the main SpringBoot application class as seen within project.

Project may also be run as a docker image, please find a sample Dockerfile defined within project.

## Swagger UI

The application has incorporated the Swagger UI utilities, to access the swagger page load the application and hit the
swagger url:

    https://<host>:<port>/swagger-ui.html

## Contributing

The branch is currently locked down and will require a pull request reviewed by a member of the AquaQ team before any
changes can be committed.
